This project has been started as my hobby project, to learn MQTT3.1.1 behaviour.
This might contains some unreliable codes. Yes, contributions are very welcome.

# Features

* MQTT 3.1.1 compliant
* QoS 0 supported.
* also QoS 1, 2 are available, although really suck implementation. don't rely it.

Misc

* WebSocket Support (might contain bugs. requires go.net/websocket)
* SSL Support
* UnixSocket Support

# Requirements

Go 1.3 higher

# Version

dev

# Quick Start

```
#momonga (MQTT Server)
go get -u github.com/PYW1/momonga/momonga
momonga -config=config.toml

#momonga_cli
go get -u github.com/PYW1/momonga/momonga_cli
momonga_cli
```

# Development

NOTE: momonga is still under development. API may change.

export GOPATH=`pwd`
go get -u github.com/PYW1/momonga/momonga

# server
go run src/github.com/PYW1/momonga/momonga/momonga.go -config=src/github.com/PYW1/momonga/config.toml

# cli
